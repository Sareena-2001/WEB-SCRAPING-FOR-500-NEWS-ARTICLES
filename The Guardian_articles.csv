Like others of her generation, she was swept up in the allure of Rajneesh’s promises: enlightenment, freedom and belonging. Osho denounced traditional religion, offering a new path to self-liberation through cathartic meditations and therapy groups, communal living and free love. In the west, they called Osho the “sex guru”.</p><p>Shortly after our arrival at Rajneesh’s ashram, I was initiated into the community and the guru gave me a new name: Ma Prem Sarito. I felt as if I now belonged, and being in the ashram was an exhilarating adventure, a portal to a world where normal boundaries dissolved. School became a distant memory. The lush gardens and nooks and crannies of the ashram were transformed into a playground where my friends and I roamed freely, liberated from structure and rules. My mother, like many other parents, embraced Rajneesh’s philosophy that children belonged not to their biological parents but to the collective.

He never actually used that phrase. What Labour’s finance spokesman did predict, however, was that his proposed top tax rate would spark “<a href=""https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191843730.001.0001/q-oro-ed5-00005282?p=emailAMAJPqOxC9Rs2&amp;amp;d=/10.1093/acref/9780191843730.001.0001/q-oro-ed5-00005282"">howls of anguish from the 80,000 people</a>” wealthy enough to pay. With Labour in power again, it seems <em>plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose</em>.

However, this is probably only the beginning of Labour’s efforts. On paper, Britain’s tax system seems relatively progressive, with a headline rate of 47% for those earning over £3m. In reality, nearly a <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article/39/3/406/7245704#414295220"">quarter</a> of this ultra-wealthy group pays less than 12% in taxes.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They open larger and larger care homes, often built on cheap land, well away from local communities.

UFO 50 review – a galaxy of 80s games brought brilliantly back to the future,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/12/ufo-50-games-review-80s-spelunky-mossmouth,"Sat, 12 Oct 2024 13:00:25 GMT","<p><strong>(Mossmouth; PC)<br /></strong>This bundle of 50 new games from the creator of Spelunky offers an electrifying range of retro genres rebooted, from point-and-click horror to Pong</p><p>When he was a schoolboy, Derek Yu, one of the first indie game superstars of the 2000s, designed games on graph paper with his friend Jon Perry. After Yu’s first major game, <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/22/spelunky-games-review-xbox"">Spelunky</a></em>, became a hit, he and Perry agreed to collaborate again, no longer as classmates but as men in their 40s. This sweet backstory infuses <em>UFO 50</em>, a dizzyingly ambitious collection of 50 games that, so the narrative framing goes, were created by a fictional games company during the eight-year period from 1982 to 1989. Each game has the aesthetic of an Atari 2600 or NES classic – chunky sprites, a warbling chiptune soundtrack – but uses current design trends and understanding to inject old-looking games with modern freshness.</p><p>Why 50? Who knows. But it’s a sufficiently high number that Yu and Perry (and some supportive developer friends) have been able to flex their design talent across an electrifying range of genres, some of which are familiar, others of which are entirely new. For example, in <em>Party House</em>, we must attempt to throw the best house party by achieving the perfect balance of guests, from vivacious but troublemaking rock stars, to pettable dogs, to comedians who bring the laughter at a financial cost. You’re scored on the quality of the evening you arrange, with penalties if the neighbours complain or the fire department decides your party has become hazardously peopled. Others attempt to perfect games of the era: <em>Night Manor</em> is a point-and-click horror story in which you’re pursued through a mansion; <em>Bushido Ball</em> an Edo-era themed version of <em>Pong</em>; <em>Rail Heist</em> a kinetic stealth-action game in which you play as an outlaw and his horse staging a series of train heists.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/12/ufo-50-games-review-80s-spelunky-mossmouth"">Continue reading...</a>"

Anything that takes longer than half an hour to make is out of the question for most people, and no one wants to spend ages on the washing-up. That’s why one-pan dishes are so popular, and why ingredients that hit our midweek comfort needs – pasta or cheese, say – feature so often.

It comes off the back of Primark’s new Durability Framework, which the fast-fashion giant says is “designed to set the bar for how retailers can extend the life of their clothing – meaning our customers will ultimately be able to love and wear their clothes for longer”.</p><p>“Durability shouldn’t be a luxury,” the retailer continued. But while the importance of extending the life of clothes is in no doubt – figures from environmental NGO WRAP show that using an item for nine months can reduce carbon, waste, and water footprints by up to 30% – Primark’s business model is designed to sell masses of clothes at extremely low prices, arguably fuelling a “buy once, wear once” mentality. So it comes as little surprise that Patrick Duffy, founder of the Global Fashion Exchange, describes the announcement as “a textbook example of greenwashing” and “nothing more than a marketing tactic to polish their image”.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/oct/10/fashion-statement-slow-fashion-quality-clothes-experts"">Continue reading...</a>"

Like others of her generation, she was swept up in the allure of Rajneesh’s promises: enlightenment, freedom and belonging. Osho denounced traditional religion, offering a new path to self-liberation through cathartic meditations and therapy groups, communal living and free love. In the west, they called Osho the “sex guru”.</p><p>Shortly after our arrival at Rajneesh’s ashram, I was initiated into the community and the guru gave me a new name: Ma Prem Sarito. I felt as if I now belonged, and being in the ashram was an exhilarating adventure, a portal to a world where normal boundaries dissolved. School became a distant memory. The lush gardens and nooks and crannies of the ashram were transformed into a playground where my friends and I roamed freely, liberated from structure and rules.

However, nearly all the largest private providers of care home places for older people are now owned by offshore private equity companies for whom profit is the prime motivation. For these companies, economies of scale, low wages, minimum staffing and cost-cutting are the order of the day. They open larger and larger care homes, often built on cheap land, well away from local communities. These silos of residents, many of whom live out their last few months in loneliness and isolation, pay tens of thousands of pounds a year for the privilege. They often have to spend their savings, and most likely will sell their house to fund their care.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/11/when-care-homes-just-dont-care"">Continue reading...</a>"

UFO 50 review – a galaxy of 80s games brought brilliantly back to the future,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/12/ufo-50-games-review-80s-spelunky-mossmouth,"Sat, 12 Oct 2024 13:00:25 GMT","<p><strong>(Mossmouth; PC)<br /></strong>This bundle of 50 new games from the creator of Spelunky offers an electrifying range of retro genres rebooted, from point-and-click horror to Pong</p><p>When he was a schoolboy, Derek Yu, one of the first indie game superstars of the 2000s, designed games on graph paper with his friend Jon Perry. After Yu’s first major game, <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/22/spelunky-games-review-xbox"">Spelunky</a></em>, became a hit, he and Perry agreed to collaborate again, no longer as classmates but as men in their 40s. This sweet backstory infuses <em>UFO 50</em>, a dizzyingly ambitious collection of 50 games that, so the narrative framing goes, were created by a fictional games company during the eight-year period from 1982 to 1989. Each game has the aesthetic of an Atari 2600 or NES classic – chunky sprites, a warbling chiptune soundtrack – but uses current design trends and understanding to inject old-looking games with modern freshness.</p><p>Why 50? Who knows. But it’s a sufficiently high number that Yu and Perry (and some supportive developer friends) have been able to flex their design talent across an electrifying range of genres, some of which are familiar, others of which are entirely new. For example, in <em>Party House</em>, we must attempt to throw the best house party by achieving the perfect balance of guests, from vivacious but troublemaking rock stars, to pettable dogs, to comedians who bring the laughter at a financial cost. You’re scored on the quality of the evening you arrange, with penalties if the neighbours complain or the fire department decides your party has become hazardously peopled. Others attempt to perfect games of the era: <em>Night Manor</em> is a point-and-click horror story in which you’re pursued through a mansion; <em>Bushido Ball</em> an Edo-era themed version of <em>Pong</em>; <em>Rail Heist</em> a kinetic stealth-action game in which you play as an outlaw and his horse staging a series of train heists.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/12/ufo-50-games-review-80s-spelunky-mossmouth"">Continue reading...</a>"

It comes off the back of Primark’s new Durability Framework, which the fast-fashion giant says is “designed to set the bar for how retailers can extend the life of their clothing – meaning our customers will ultimately be able to love and wear their clothes for longer”.</p><p>“Durability shouldn’t be a luxury,” the retailer continued. But while the importance of extending the life of clothes is in no doubt – figures from environmental NGO WRAP show that using an item for nine months can reduce carbon, waste, and water footprints by up to 30% – Primark’s business model is designed to sell masses of clothes at extremely low prices, arguably fuelling a “buy once, wear once” mentality. So it comes as little surprise that Patrick Duffy, founder of the Global Fashion Exchange, describes the announcement as “a textbook example of greenwashing” and “nothing more than a marketing tactic to polish their image”.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/oct/10/fashion-statement-slow-fashion-quality-clothes-experts"">Continue reading...</a>"

And then I thought: Hey, maybe this is possible. I had spent time with Francis in San Francisco. He was a leader, a doer and a risk taker. I saw that he carried himself with confidence, and that gave me faith in him. But this wasn’t a thing that was done at the time. Wouldn’t the studio, Paramount, go to older directors who had reputations, not this talented, young avant-garde intellectual?

Like others of her generation, she was swept up in the allure of Rajneesh’s promises: enlightenment, freedom and belonging. Osho denounced traditional religion, offering a new path to self-liberation through cathartic meditations and therapy groups, communal living and free love. In the west, they called Osho the “sex guru”.</p><p>Shortly after our arrival at Rajneesh’s ashram, I was initiated into the community and the guru gave me a new name: Ma Prem Sarito. I felt as if I now belonged, and being in the ashram was an exhilarating adventure, a portal to a world where normal boundaries dissolved. School became a distant memory. The lush gardens and nooks and crannies of the ashram were transformed into a playground where my friends and I roamed freely, liberated from structure and rules. My mother, like many other parents, embraced Rajneesh’s philosophy that children belonged not to their biological parents but to the collective.

It juxtaposes Shackleton’s extraordinary battle to survive with the modern-day scientists’ struggle to locate the Endurance wreck, with tiggerish Dan Snow on board bouncing amiably about – and it is a pretty glib alignment.</p><p>Furthermore, the black-and-white footage taken at the time by Shackleton’s famous embedded cinematographer Frank Hurley has been colourised, and passages from the journals of Shackleton and others are read aloud by AI-generated voices, taken (evidently) from existing recordings by the actual adventurers themselves; this is a presumptuous and flashy way of gussying the whole drama up.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/12/endurance-review-ernest-shackleton-antarctica-wreck"">Continue reading...</a>"
UFO 50 review – a galaxy of 80s games brought brilliantly back to the future,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/12/ufo-50-games-review-80s-spelunky-mossmouth,"Sat, 12 Oct 2024 13:00:25 GMT","<p><strong>(Mossmouth; PC)<br /></strong>This bundle of 50 new games from the creator of Spelunky offers an electrifying range of retro genres rebooted, from point-and-click horror to Pong</p><p>When he was a schoolboy, Derek Yu, one of the first indie game superstars of the 2000s, designed games on graph paper with his friend Jon Perry. After Yu’s first major game, <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/22/spelunky-games-review-xbox"">Spelunky</a></em>, became a hit, he and Perry agreed to collaborate again, no longer as classmates but as men in their 40s. This sweet backstory infuses <em>UFO 50</em>, a dizzyingly ambitious collection of 50 games that, so the narrative framing goes, were created by a fictional games company during the eight-year period from 1982 to 1989. Each game has the aesthetic of an Atari 2600 or NES classic – chunky sprites, a warbling chiptune soundtrack – but uses current design trends and understanding to inject old-looking games with modern freshness.</p><p>Why 50? Who knows. But it’s a sufficiently high number that Yu and Perry (and some supportive developer friends) have been able to flex their design talent across an electrifying range of genres, some of which are familiar, others of which are entirely new. For example, in <em>Party House</em>, we must attempt to throw the best house party by achieving the perfect balance of guests, from vivacious but troublemaking rock stars, to pettable dogs, to comedians who bring the laughter at a financial cost. You’re scored on the quality of the evening you arrange, with penalties if the neighbours complain or the fire department decides your party has become hazardously peopled. Others attempt to perfect games of the era: <em>Night Manor</em> is a point-and-click horror story in which you’re pursued through a mansion; <em>Bushido Ball</em> an Edo-era themed version of <em>Pong</em>; <em>Rail Heist</em> a kinetic stealth-action game in which you play as an outlaw and his horse staging a series of train heists.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/12/ufo-50-games-review-80s-spelunky-mossmouth"">Continue reading...</a>"

Hannah Fry unravels the psychology behind how we see ourselves …</p><p>It’s strange to imagine, but before mirrors became commonplace, most people would not be well acquainted with what their own faces would look like. Apart from maybe the occasional glimpse in a river, the internal self-image of many of our ancestors would have been based only on how others reacted to them, not on what they actually looked like.</p><p>Physical mirrors have been in existence in one form or another for thousands of years, but as recently as the 1960s, the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter came across a remote tribe in Papua New Guinea, known as the Biami, who (as far as he could tell) had not yet seen them.</p><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6<br /><br />

Sign up here</a></strong></p><p>This week more than most, we have been hearing a certain word uttered in fashion circles. Alongside “<a href=""https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/style/janties-denim-underwear-yproject-panties-thong-a4113071.html"">janties</a>”, “<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/style/hedi-slimane-celine-chanel.html"">Hedi Slimane</a>” and “kilts”, a perhaps less expected – or, at least, less glitzy – word has been taking up airtime: durability. It comes off the back of Primark’s new Durability Framework, which the fast-fashion giant says is “designed to set the bar for how retailers can extend the life of their clothing – meaning our customers will ultimately be able to love and wear their clothes for longer”.</p><p>“Durability shouldn’t be a luxury,” the retailer continued. But while the importance of extending the life of clothes is in no doubt – figures from environmental NGO WRAP show that using an item for nine months can reduce carbon, waste, and water footprints by up to 30% – Primark’s business model is designed to sell masses of clothes at extremely low prices, arguably fuelling a “buy once, wear once” mentality. So it comes as little surprise that Patrick Duffy, founder of the Global Fashion Exchange, describes the announcement as “a textbook example of greenwashing” and “nothing more than a marketing tactic to polish their image”.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/oct/10/fashion-statement-slow-fashion-quality-clothes-experts"">Continue reading...</a>"

My abuse in the Osho Rajneesh cult has haunted me for decades. Now I’m ready to speak out | Sarito Carroll,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/12/abuse-rajneesh-cult-children-communes,"Sat, 12 Oct 2024 07:00:18 GMT","<p>Children like me, abused under the guise of ‘liberation’, have been left out of narratives about spiritual communes – until now</p><p>In 1978, when I was nine years old, I unexpectedly moved to India with my free-spirited mother, who had recently become a disciple of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/07/cult-oregon-1980s-terror-netflix-documentary-wild-country"">Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later known as Osho)</a>. Like others of her generation, she was swept up in the allure of Rajneesh’s promises: enlightenment, freedom and belonging. Osho denounced traditional religion, offering a new path to self-liberation through cathartic meditations and therapy groups, communal living and free love. In the west, they called Osho the “sex guru”.</p><p>Shortly after our arrival at Rajneesh’s ashram, I was initiated into the community and the guru gave me a new name: Ma Prem Sarito. I felt as if I now belonged, and being in the ashram was an exhilarating adventure, a portal to a world where normal boundaries dissolved. School became a distant memory. The lush gardens and nooks and crannies of the ashram were transformed into a playground where my friends and I roamed freely, liberated from structure and rules. My mother, like many other parents, embraced Rajneesh’s philosophy that children belonged not to their biological parents but to the collective. Before long, I moved into the ashram and rarely interacted with my mother.</p><p>Sarito Carroll is featured in the film <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/02/children-of-the-cult-review-osho-commune-bhagwan-shree-rajneesh-wild-wild-country"">Children of the Cult</a> which screens Sunday 13 October <a href=""https://www.itv.com/presscentre/epweekweek-42-2024-sat-12-oct-fri-18-oct/children-cult"">on ITV and ITVX at 10.20pm</a>.

He never actually used that phrase. What Labour’s finance spokesman did predict, however, was that his proposed top tax rate would spark “<a href=""https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191843730.001.0001/q-oro-ed5-00005282?p=emailAMAJPqOxC9Rs2&amp;amp;d=/10.1093/acref/9780191843730.001.0001/q-oro-ed5-00005282"">howls of anguish from the 80,000 people</a>” wealthy enough to pay.

In reality, nearly a <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article/39/3/406/7245704#414295220"">quarter</a> of this ultra-wealthy group pays less than 12% in taxes.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

UFO 50 review – a galaxy of 80s games brought brilliantly back to the future,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/12/ufo-50-games-review-80s-spelunky-mossmouth,"Sat, 12 Oct 2024 13:00:25 GMT","<p><strong>(Mossmouth; PC)<br /></strong>This bundle of 50 new games from the creator of Spelunky offers an electrifying range of retro genres rebooted, from point-and-click horror to Pong</p><p>When he was a schoolboy, Derek Yu, one of the first indie game superstars of the 2000s, designed games on graph paper with his friend Jon Perry. After Yu’s first major game, <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/22/spelunky-games-review-xbox"">Spelunky</a></em>, became a hit, he and Perry agreed to collaborate again, no longer as classmates but as men in their 40s. This sweet backstory infuses <em>UFO 50</em>, a dizzyingly ambitious collection of 50 games that, so the narrative framing goes, were created by a fictional games company during the eight-year period from 1982 to 1989. Each game has the aesthetic of an Atari 2600 or NES classic – chunky sprites, a warbling chiptune soundtrack – but uses current design trends and understanding to inject old-looking games with modern freshness.</p><p>Why 50? Who knows. But it’s a sufficiently high number that Yu and Perry (and some supportive developer friends) have been able to flex their design talent across an electrifying range of genres, some of which are familiar, others of which are entirely new. For example, in <em>Party House</em>, we must attempt to throw the best house party by achieving the perfect balance of guests, from vivacious but troublemaking rock stars, to pettable dogs, to comedians who bring the laughter at a financial cost. You’re scored on the quality of the evening you arrange, with penalties if the neighbours complain or the fire department decides your party has become hazardously peopled. Others attempt to perfect games of the era: <em>Night Manor</em> is a point-and-click horror story in which you’re pursued through a mansion; <em>Bushido Ball</em> an Edo-era themed version of <em>Pong</em>; <em>Rail Heist</em> a kinetic stealth-action game in which you play as an outlaw and his horse staging a series of train heists.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/12/ufo-50-games-review-80s-spelunky-mossmouth"">Continue reading...</a>"

Or why the people you love always look much better in real life than photos? Hannah Fry unravels the psychology behind how we see ourselves …</p><p>It’s strange to imagine, but before mirrors became commonplace, most people would not be well acquainted with what their own faces would look like. Apart from maybe the occasional glimpse in a river, the internal self-image of many of our ancestors would have been based only on how others reacted to them, not on what they actually looked like.</p><p>Physical mirrors have been in existence in one form or another for thousands of years, but as recently as the 1960s, the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter came across a remote tribe in Papua New Guinea, known as the Biami, who (as far as he could tell) had not yet seen them.</p><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6<br /><br />

The term implies that bandwidth is fairly low, so something pretty straightforward is called for. Anything that takes longer than half an hour to make is out of the question for most people, and no one wants to spend ages on the washing-up. That’s why one-pan dishes are so popular, and why ingredients that hit our midweek comfort needs – pasta or cheese, say – feature so often. At the same time, however, midweek meals aren’t just about instant carbs and melted cheese. More often than not, in fact, much depends on what sort of week you’re having.

Sign up here</a></strong></p><p>This week more than most, we have been hearing a certain word uttered in fashion circles. Alongside “<a href=""https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/style/janties-denim-underwear-yproject-panties-thong-a4113071.html"">janties</a>”, “<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/style/hedi-slimane-celine-chanel.html"">Hedi Slimane</a>” and “kilts”, a perhaps less expected – or, at least, less glitzy – word has been taking up airtime: durability. It comes off the back of Primark’s new Durability Framework, which the fast-fashion giant says is “designed to set the bar for how retailers can extend the life of their clothing – meaning our customers will ultimately be able to love and wear their clothes for longer”.</p><p>“Durability shouldn’t be a luxury,” the retailer continued. But while the importance of extending the life of clothes is in no doubt – figures from environmental NGO WRAP show that using an item for nine months can reduce carbon, waste, and water footprints by up to 30% – Primark’s business model is designed to sell masses of clothes at extremely low prices, arguably fuelling a “buy once, wear once” mentality. So it comes as little surprise that Patrick Duffy, founder of the Global Fashion Exchange, describes the announcement as “a textbook example of greenwashing” and “nothing more than a marketing tactic to polish their image”.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/oct/10/fashion-statement-slow-fashion-quality-clothes-experts"">Continue reading...</a>"
